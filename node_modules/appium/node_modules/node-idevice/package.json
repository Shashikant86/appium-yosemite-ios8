Be warned this is pretty long.\n\nWe currently support installing, removing and listing apps on a device.\n### Installing\n```javascript\nvar app = path.resolve(__dirname, '../path/to/your/App.ipa');\ndevice.install(app, function (err) {\n\t// Do stuff when app is installed\n});\n```\n### Note\nideviceinstaller consumes IPA packages, please see the [docs](https://github.com/OniOni/node-idevice/blob/master/docs/building_ipa.md) on how to get an IPA from your App.\n\n### Removing\n```javascript\ndevice.remove('domain.organisation.App', function (err) {\n\t// Do stuff when app is installed\n});\n```\n### Checking if an app is Installed\n```javascript\ndevice.isInstalled(appName, function (err, installed) {\n\t// Installed is true when app is found on device\n});\n```\n### Listing Installed apps\n```javascript\ndevice.listInstalled(function (err, data) {\n\t// data is a list of objects, one per app\n\t// The object contains info about the app, currently 'name' and 'fullname'\n});\n```\n",
